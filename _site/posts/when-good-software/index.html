  <h1 class="post-title">When good software design yields a poor product.</h1>
  <h2 class="post-date"><span>June  8, 2012</span></h2>

  <div class='post-content'>
    <p>This post is based off of my Advanced Software Architecture project at my final year at UBC. I understand that the purpose of the course was not to build a useful or usable product, just a well-built product.</p>

<p>We just handed in our software project, Eversharedocbox, a tool for sharing files and collaborating as a group regardless of if you’re using Googledocs, Evernote or Dropbox.</p>

<p>Our design review went well, we received 90%. Our live demo went well, we received 100%. Our test suite was extensive with over 50% of line-coverage. We ran software to find potential bugs, it found none. Our security was deep too, protecting against many common security threats. It was a text-book perfect example of a well architected, well built, and well-tested piece of software.</p>

<p>But it was a crap product. I’d never use it because it wasn’t solving a problem I (and many other people) needed solving.</p>

<p>My professsor made a one fundamental flaw when it comes to building a product: he asked us to start with the technology first. This is called techno(logical)-centered design, the opposite of user-centered design.</p>

<p>Instead of starting with a problem and working backwards to find what technology we could use to solve the problem we were told we had to start with Java, plus two web API’s and work our way forward to seeing what kinds problems we might be able to solve with it.</p>

<p>Being limited to Java as a programming language was a big issue: development is very slow. Instead of finding better solutions to a problem, we spent most of our time solving Java-related problems. I’m not saying Java is bad, just not suited to our problem.</p>

<p>I can see the appeal of getting hyped about technology. Java has a big community, there’s technologically impressive tools to play with like Spring and Hibernate. I saw people do the same thing with the iPad, all of a sudden people were thinking about how cool the technology was and what kind of problems they could solve with it.</p>

<p>People also get excited about good software design: using every software architectural design practice, extensive test coverage and building software that’s extremely scalable. The truth is users just don’t care. They care if it solves their problems and solves it well.</p>

<p>I’m not saying you can’t make a good product that solves a lot of peoples problems starting with the technology first. Just don’t be surprised when you end up a cool piece of software that no one wants to use.</p>
