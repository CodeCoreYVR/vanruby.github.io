# VanRuby

We are from Vancouver and we build cool stuff with Ruby! This is our website built with Ruby and the static site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/website`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve --watch`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.
