      <h4>Beginner's Guide to IRC</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Choose an IRC client from the list on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
        <p>With most clients, you will be disconnected from IRC when your computer sleeps or when you exit the client. You can use a paid service like <a href="https://www.irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a> to stay connected 24/7. The IRCCloud free tier keeps your connection alive for 2 hours, logging all chat history during this time. This is useful in case someone answers your questions while you are away. You will also receive notifications on your phone if you install the iOS or Android apps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Open your client and go through configuration. You should only need to set a nickname for now.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        Before you can start chatting in the #vanruby IRC channel, you need to connect to a network. <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> is where you will find #vanruby, #rubyonrails, and #ruby-lang.
        </p>
        <p>
        The textfield at the bottom of your client is where you will send messages and IRC commands. <code>/help</code> lists available commands.
        </p>
        <p>
        <code>/connect freenode</code> is the command to join the Freenode network.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        Once connected to Freenode, send <code>/join #vanruby</code> and start chatting with local Ruby programmers! You should see a list of members in the sidebar once you are in the channel.
        </p>
        </li>

        If no one responds to you, they are not ignoring you. They are just busy :) . Also try #rubyonrails and #ruby-lang if you need help. Make sure you read and follow the channel rules linked in the channel header (Note: to chat in #rubyonrails, you need to <a href="https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering">register</a> your nickname).
